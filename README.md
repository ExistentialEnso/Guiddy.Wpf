# Guiddy WPF
This is the WPF version of the GUID generation tool, Guiddy. The point of the tool is simple: the convenient generation of GUIDs for use in various aspects of app/data work. **This is a very simple app.** But by offering some flexibility in terms of hyphenation and casing along with the ability to auto-copy the new GUID to a clipbaord gives it some added utility.
